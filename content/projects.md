<a href="https://macrobuddy.com" target="_blank">MacroBuddy</a>
<p>
  Created a web app for my senior project that allows users to find recipes based on their macro/micro nutrient needs and diet type. The project utilizes the Spoonacular API on the backend and the GatsbyJS framework along with react-bootstrap components on the frontend.

<h4>Diet Prescription Calculator</h4>
<p>
  During this summer, I worked with the UF Genetics Institute to develop an all-in-one diet prescription calculator that would allow users to calculate daily energy expenditure, supplement intake recommendations, patient meal intake with macronutrient and micronutrient breakdown, and final diet prescription calculations for precision ketogenic therapy (PKT).

<a href="https://nightowls-study-spots.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">UF Study Spots</a>
<p>
  Created a web app using the MEAN stack and Agile development methods to show different
  study spots on the University of Florida campus. Using the Facebook API, we required users to sign in
  with their Facebook accounts to use the app. The Mapbox API was used to display different buildings
  on campus. Within each pin, the user can see the spots on campus as well as check in to a spot. If users
  finds a new study spot, they are able to add that location on the map. Users are also able to rate the study spots.

<a href="https://github.com/ahadvirani/HuffmanAlg" target="_blank">Implementation of Huffman Algorithm</a>
<p>Created a program using Java that generated a Huffman tree to count the frequency of char values in a file. Project utilized hash tables and binary trees data structures.t</p>

<a href="https://github.com/ahadvirani/SortingAnalysis" target="_blank">Analysis of Different Sorting Algorithms</a>
<p>Analyzed the computational complexity of merge sort and selection sort algorithms. Three cases were tested (ascending order, descending order and random order) 10 times for each sorting method.</p>

<a href="https://github.com/ahadvirani/SparseMatrix" target="_blank">Sparse Matrix Addition and Subtraction</a>
<p>Created a program using Java that will implement a sparse matrix using linked lists and then perform addition of two matrices and multiplication of two matrices.</p>
