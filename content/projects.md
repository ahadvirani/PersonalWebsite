<p>
  Created a web app using the MEAN stack and Agile development methods to show different
  study spots on the University of Florida campus. Using the Facebook API, we required users to sign in
  with their Facebook accounts to use the app. The Mapbox API was used to display different buildings
  on campus. Within each pin, the user can see the spots on campus as well as check in to a spot. If users
  finds a new study spot, they are able to add that location on the map. Users are also able to rate the study spots.
